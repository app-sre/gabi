# GABI: (G)o (A)uditable D(B) (I)nterface

Improving tenant quality of life for database access while following Site Reliability Engineering best practices.

**Note:** GABI is under active development and is not suitable for production use!

## Description

`GABI` is a service that provides an interface for tenants and SREs to run SQL queries on protected databases without
exposing credentials, complete with audit capabilities to comply with certifications (i.e., SOC-2). Organizations that
adopt SRE best practices are often found walking a tight line between developer happiness and full regulatory
compliance. One common area of conflict is database access. Developers are familiar with read-and-write access during
their project work but find production restrictions on databases frustrating and time-consuming. `GABI` attempts to
bridge the gap between SRE and developer needs by providing an auditable, secure, and available interface to query
databases.

### Best Practice vs Best Effort

"Best Practice" applications are applications that are fully onboarded according to SRE best practices, with the end
result of SREs taking responsibility for service health (i.e., carrying the pager).

"Best Effort" applications are run in SRE-defined runtime environments but, by choice or design, do not
follow all requirements mandated by the SRE team. These applications enjoy the benefits of SRE-led infrastructure, but
the SRE team is not tasked with carrying the pager for these services.

This stratified support model is supported in `GABI` with RBAC restrictions. Instances of `GABI` can be set to read-only
mode to support "best practice" services through read-replica databases. Optionally, read/write
mode can be enabled for primary databases, supporting "best effort" services.

### GitOps

To the joy of many SREs, `GABI` is created with GitOps in mind. In addition to allowing HTTP requests to the service
from a developer's machine, a reconciliation server can manage to interact with the API and can execute queries as part
of PR or MR hooks. This allows for a complete GitOps workflow and includes the added benefits of tracking each query
through version-controlled files.

### Secret Management

The service consumes database access credentials through environment variables. There are a multitude of secret
management techniques that can supply environment variables to Kubernetes pods, such as Vault, Kubernetes Secrets,
ConfigMaps, and more. This approach implies that one instance of `GABI` is needed for each database, as each instance of
`GABI` will only execute queries on the database defined at pod creation time.

### Supported Databases

Currently, `GABI` supports MySQL and PostgreSQL. The database interface is written with `sql.DB`, so other database
types will be easy to implement, and we welcome contributions from the community.

### Runtime Environment

The service is written in the Go programming language intended to run as a Kubernetes or OpenShift workload. In addition
to a Kubernetes workload, the application can run in a standalone Docker container or as a CLI app (not recommended).


## Quick start

`TODO`

Create a `config.json` file with the following content and set its path using `CONFIG_FILE_PATH`:

Note: the expiration date has to be set in the future.

```
{
  "expiration": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "users": [
    "user1",
    "user2"
  ]
}
 ```

To use the deprecated users file, create a text file (historically, the file name as been `authorized-users.yaml`) and
then set its path using `USERS_FILE_PATH`:


```
user1
user2
```

Note: using the deprecated users file will disable support of the explicit expiration date in GABI, leaving only the
legacy implicit one active.

Next, start the GABI server instance:

```
$ source .env.dev
$ go run cmd/gabi/main.go

```

An example query against a PostgreSQL to check for the existance of a specific table in the database (single quotes need
to be replaced with `'\''` in queries run with curl):

```
$ curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/query' -X POST -H 'X-Forwarded-User: test' -d '{"query":"select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema='\''public'\''"}' | jq
{
  "result": [
    [
      "table_name"
    ],
    [
      "persons"
    ]
  ],
  "error": ""
}
```
